          <h1>Hello, and a warm welcome to SafetyNet!</h1>
          <h2>...but what is it?</h2>
          <p>The term "health and safety" can indicate many implicit definitions. For example, it may imply a combination of phenomena that are typically associated with <strong>health</strong>(wellbeing, protection from the elements) and those that are associated with <strong>safety</strong>(confidence and security). In an ideal society, the resulting principles would be used to create workplace environments in which employees are free to spend their time productively, while being insulated from dangers and accidents that could cause disease and injury.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Of course, we do not live in an ideal society. Now, more than ever, it is essential that we follow the neccesarry guidelines in order to protect ourselves and those around us. SafetyNet provides a platform that will allow you and other users to positively contribute towards the posting and sharing of important news, video, files and ideas for the journey ahead.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Since you are a new user, please accept these 10 Thanks. You can give them to other users by liking their content(and gain them from other users liking yours; you also get 1 Thank for every 10 posts you make, and 5 Thanks by logging in once a day). In addition, the first three posts that you like/share will net you double the allocated reward(s).</p>
          <br>
          <p>If you are able to get at least 30 Thanks from other users, you will be able to <strong>increase your player level any time you visit your profile page</strong>. This will allow you to unlock extra features within the website, including the ability to update your user profile to however you see fit. Keep in mind, this will reduce your Thanks by 30, although you will still have a record of the amount of Thanks you have acclumated since you signed up.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Stay safe.</p>
